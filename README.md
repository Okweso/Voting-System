**University VOTING SYSTEM**

This is a university/College voting system. The system enables students to vote for their candidates of choice and submit their votes. Immediately after submitting the votes, they are able to see the results as voting continues. However, once a student votes, they are not able to vote again but can see as results continue streaming in. Only registered voters are able to vote. To access the voting page, a voter must first log in and be authenticated.

There are voter admins who are registered by the overall system administrator. Their role is to register candidates and set the voting date and time. Voting can only take place within the set timeline by the voter admins. Once the duration scheduled for voting is over, the submit button will be disabled and no voting can take place.
